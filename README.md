# Universal Data Connections & Integrations in Python

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive showcase of connecting Python to a wide variety of data and analytics platforms—including SQL and NoSQL databases, ETL and integration engines, RESTful APIs, and business visualization tools. It demonstrates essential hands-on tasks and connection checks across industry-standard technologies, offering a modular toolkit for students, analysts, engineers, and anyone exploring modern data infrastructure.

## Included Platforms & Technologies

### Relational Databases (SQL)
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- BigQuery
- Redshift

### NoSQL & Cloud Databases
- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- Redis
- DynamoDB
- Couchbase
- Elasticsearch
- Firestore

### ETL & Integration Tools
- Apache Airflow
- Talend
- Pentaho (Kettle)
- dbt (Data Build Tool)
- Prefect

### Visualization & Dashboarding
- Tableau
- Power BI
- Plotly Dash
- Google Data Studio (Looker Studio)

### REST API Basics
- Universal template for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE using `requests`
- Example with public test APIs for safe experimentation

## Key Functions & What You Will Learn

- **Connection Readiness:** Scripts test and confirm successful connectivity/authentication to each platform.
- **Basic Operations:** Simple tasks for querying, inserting, updating, deleting, and reporting.
- **Integration Workflows:** Launch sample ETL jobs, pipeline runs, and dashboard renderers.
- **Modularity:** Each script is self-contained—easy for newcomers and advanced users to adapt, expand, or combine.
- **Credentials & Setup:** Includes comments and patterns for credential handling and environment preparation.

## Usage Instructions

1. Install packages needed for your platforms (`sqlalchemy`, `requests`, `pymongo`, `cassandra-driver`, `redis`, `boto3`, `couchbase`, `elasticsearch`, `google-cloud-firestore`, `dash`, etc).
2. Update connection strings, credentials, hostnames, and paths in each script to match your environment or sandbox.
3. Run desired scripts to verify connectivity and basic operations.
4. Expand code for advanced modeling, production workflows, and business analytics as needed.

## Educational Focus

This toolkit is designed to **introduce and demonstrate universal data connectivity** in the real analytics/data engineering landscape. It is ideal for students, early-career analysts, and interview preparation, as well as onboarding to new teams.

## Disclaimer

These scripts and workflow samples are provided for educational purposes and basic connectivity verification, not for sensitive or production use. Always secure credentials, handle errors, and use best practices in real projects.
