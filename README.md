# Universal Data Connections in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates Python connection and query/test code for multiple major analytics platformsâ€”PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, and a sample API. Each connector includes a basic function or query to confirm the connection is operational.

## Supported Platforms
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Google BigQuery
- AWS Redshift
- API/Web Service (requests)

## How It Works
- Each function creates a connection, runs a test query or API call, and prints the result.
- Modular format allows plugging in real credentials for basic operational validation.

## Usage
1. Edit credentials for your system.
2. Install required libraries (`sqlalchemy`, `pymysql`, `psycopg2`, `google-cloud-bigquery`, `requests`).
3. Run `universal_connections.py` and confirm output.
